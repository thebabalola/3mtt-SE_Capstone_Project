- `README.md`: Provides an overview and documentation for the project


## Setup Instructions

## Backend Integration

This project currently uses mock data and simulated API calls. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Replace the simulated API calls in `auth.js` and `dashboard.js` with actual AJAX requests to your backend server.
2. Implement proper error handling for API responses.
3. Ensure your backend provides endpoints for user authentication, task management, and user profile operations.
